# QueryNest
QueryNest is designed to simulate a real-world question-answer forum where users can register, log in, ask questions, and answer others’ queries. Each user can manage their own content, while questions are organized by categories for better navigation. The application focuses on clean UI, user experience, and secure PHP coding practices.
